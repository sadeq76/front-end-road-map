## **JavaScript**

### Introduction
#### What is JavaScript and Why Do We Need It?
JavaScript (JS) is a **high-level, lightweight, and cross-platform programming language** primarily used to make web pages interactive. It is:
- **High-level**: Abstracts complex computer operations into easy-to-understand commands.
- **Dynamically Typed**: Variable types are determined at runtime.
- **Multi-paradigm**: Supports multiple programming styles, including:
  - **Event-driven**
  - **Object-oriented**
  - **Functional programming**
- **Single-threaded with Asynchronous Capabilities**: Executes code sequentially but can handle asynchronous tasks using event loops, promises, and async/await.
- **Interactive Web Applications**: Powers dynamic behavior on websites, such as form validation, animations, and API requests.

#### History
JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich in 1995 in just 10 days. Initially called **Mocha**, then **LiveScript**, it was renamed to JavaScript to align with Java's popularity, though the two languages are fundamentally different.

#### How to Run JavaScript
- **In the Browser**: Use the browser console (e.g., Chrome DevTools).
- **With Node.js**: Run JavaScript in a server-side environment.
- **Code Editors and IDEs**: Tools like VS Code with plugins for real-time feedback.

#### Compiler or Interpreter?
JavaScript is an **interpreted language**, meaning the browser or Node.js engine reads and executes the code directly. Modern engines like **V8** use Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation to optimize performance.

### Variables
#### Declaration Keywords
- **`let`**: Block-scoped, reassignable.
- **`const`**: Block-scoped, not reassignable.
- **`var`**: Function-scoped, hoisted, and considered outdated.
#### Naming Rules
- Must start with a letter, `_`, or `$`.
- Cannot use reserved keywords (e.g., `if`, `function`).

### Data Types
#### Dynamically Typed
Variables can hold different types of values during runtime.

#### Typeof Operator
Used to check the type of a variable.

#### Primitive Types
- **Numbers**: Integer and floating-point numbers.
- **Strings**: Text values.
  - String templates (e.g., `` `Hello, ${name}!` ``)
  - Methods: `slice()`, `toUpperCase()`, `includes()`, etc.
- **Booleans**: `true` or `false`.
- **Undefined**: Variable declared but not assigned a value.
- **Null**: Intentional absence of any value.
- **Symbols**: Unique, immutable identifiers.
- **BigInt**: Large integers beyond `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`.

#### Reference Types (Objects)
- **Objects**: Key-value pairs.
  - Methods: `Object.keys()`, `Object.values()`.
  - Object protection: `freeze()`, `seal()`.
- **Arrays**: Ordered collection of items.
  - Methods: `push()`, `pop()`, `map()`, `filter()`.
- **Functions**: First-class citizens.
- **Set**: Collection of unique values.
- **Map**: Key-value pairs with ordered keys.
- **WeakMap** and **WeakSet**: Hold weak references to objects.

### Type Conversion/Coercion
- **Implicit Type Casting**: Done automatically (e.g., `"5" * 2` → `10`).
- **Explicit Type Casting**: Done using functions like `Number()`, `String()`, `Boolean()`.

### Operators
### Types of Operators
- **Arithmetic**: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`.
- **Comparison**: `===`, `!==`, `<`, `>`.
- **Logical**: `&&`, `||`, `!`.
- **Bitwise**: `&`, `|`, `^`.
- **Assignment**: `=`, `+=`, `-=`.
- **String Operators**: Concatenation (`+`).
- **Comma Operator**: `,` evaluates multiple expressions.

#### Equalities
- **Strict equality**: `===`.
- **Loose equality**: `==`.
- **Same-value equality**: Handles `NaN`.
- **Same-value-zero equality**: Used in `Set` and `Map`.

### Conditionals
- **If Statements**: Basic conditional logic.
- **Ternary Operator**: `condition ? valueIfTrue : valueIfFalse`.
- **Switch Statements**: Alternative to multiple `if-else` blocks.

### Loops
- **For Loop**: Iterates with a counter.
- **For-In**: Iterates over object properties.
- **For-Of**: Iterates over iterable objects like arrays.
- **While**: Repeats while a condition is true.
- **Do-While**: Executes at least once.
- **Break/Continue**: Controls loop execution.

### Functions
- **First-Class Functions**: Can be assigned to variables or passed as arguments.
- **Higher-Order Functions**: Accept or return other functions.
- **Parameters**: Default, rest, and destructured.
- **IIFEs**: Immediately Invoked Function Expressions.
- **Callbacks**: Functions passed as arguments.
- **Explicit Binding**: Using `call`, `apply`, or `bind`.

### Scopes
- **Global vs Local Scope**: Variables defined inside or outside functions.
- **Function Scope vs Block Scope**: `var` vs `let` and `const`.
- **Lexical Scope**: Functions use variables from their defining scope.

### Hoisting
- **Variables**: `var` is hoisted, `let` and `const` are not initialized.
- **Functions**: Function declarations are hoisted.

### Memory Management
- **Memory Allocation**: Stack and heap.
- **Garbage Collection**: Automatically reclaims unused memory.
